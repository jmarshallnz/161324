## Logistic Regression

-   LDA, KDA and Naive Bayes classifiers are all generative.

    -   They model $\mathsf{P}(j|\mathbf{x})$ by first learning $f_j(\mathbf{x})$ and $\pi_j$.

-   Alternative is to attempt to learn posterior probabilities
    $\mathsf{P}(j | \mathbf{x})$ directly.

    -   Gives **discriminatory** classifiers.

-   One approach is to assume that $\mathsf{P}(j | \mathbf{x})$ takes a particular
    parametric form, then estimate parameters from training data.

-   **Logistic regression** is one such technique.

---

## Introduction to Logistic Regression

-   Logistic regression is one of a class of methods known as
    **generalised linear models** (GLMs).

-   It is closely related to linear regression.

-   A critical difference is that the response (target) variable $y$
    need not be distributed according to a normal distribution.

-   Logistic regression models a **binary** response variable (i.e. two
    classes), values written as 0 and 1.

    -   These can code for classes 1 and 2 respectively in two class
        problems.

-   Model usually described in terms of $p(\mathbf{x}) = \mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x})$

-   Extensions to more than two classes will come later.

---

## Introduction to Logistic Regression

-   Want to estimate posterior probability
    $p(\mathbf{x}) =  \mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}) = \mathsf{P}(j=2 | \mathbf{x})$.

-   Given that this is a number, why not use linear regression?

-   That would give
    $p(\mathbf{x}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p$

    -   Aside: beware notational confusion for $p$ between
        $p(\mathbf{x}) = \mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}) = \mathsf{P}(j=2 | \mathbf{x})$, and $p$ as the number
        of predictors.

-   Problem: linear regression does not respect $[0,1]$ range for
    probability.

-   E.g. suppose we have single predictor variable, and fitted model is
    $\hat p(x) = 0.3 + 0.1 x$.

    -   We run into trouble if $x < -3$ or $x > 7$.

---

## Introduction to Logistic Regression

-   Solution is to use type of sigmoid function that you met when
    looking at neural networks.

-   Model probability $p(\mathbf{x})$ via the **logistic** (or sigmoid)
    function: $$p(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta(\mathbf{x})}}$$ where
    $\theta(\mathbf{x})$ is called the **linear predictor**, given by
    $$\theta(\mathbf{x}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p.$$

-   The inverse of the logistic function is the **logit** or log-odds
    function
    $$\theta(\mathbf{x}) = \mathsf{logit}(p(\mathbf{x})) = \log\left(\frac{p(\mathbf{x})}{1-p(\mathbf{x})}\right).$$

---

## Logistic and logit curves

```{r logistic, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.dim=c(7, 3)}
g1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = ~1/(1+exp(-.x)), xlim=c(-5, 5)) +
  labs(x = expression(theta),
       y = expression(p),
       title = "logistic function")

g2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = ~log(.x/(1-.x)), xlim=c(0.00001, 0.99999)) +
  labs(x = expression(p),
       y = expression(theta),
       title = "logit function")

g1+g2
```

-   Any value of linear predictor $-\infty \le \theta \le \infty$
    corresponds to a feasible probability $0 < p < 1$.

---

## Summary Formulation of Logistic Regression

$$\begin{aligned}
y_i &\sim \mathsf{Bernoulli}(p(\mathbf{x}_i))\\
\mathsf{logit}(p(\mathbf{x}_i)) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{ip}.\end{aligned}$$
where

-   $y_i$ is the response (target) variable for $i$th observation (record).

-   $p(\mathbf{x}_i) =\mathsf{P}(y_i = 1 | \mathbf{x}_i)$, where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is vector of
    predictors (features) for $i$th observation.

-   Predictors may be quantitative, or factors coded as 0/1 indicator variables.

    -   Just like for linear regression models.

-   $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ are unknown regression parameters.

    -   Need estimating from training data.

---

## Fitting Logistic Regression Models

-   Minimizing sum of squared errors is not a natural way of estimating
    coefficients $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$.

-   Instead, we estimate them by maximising the **likelihood** function.

-   The likelihood is just the probability of the data viewed as a
    function of $\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$, with data fixed.

-   The likelihood for logistic regression is therefore
    $$\begin{aligned}L(\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p) &= \prod_{i=1}^n \mathsf{P}(y_i | \mathbf{x}_i, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p) \\ &= \prod_{i=1}^n p(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\beta})^{y_i} (1 - p(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\beta}))^{1-y_i}\end{aligned}$$
    where $p(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\beta})$ emphasises dependence of $p(\mathbf{x}_i)$ of
    $\mathbf{\beta} = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p)^\mathsf{T}$.

---

## Fitting Logistic Regression Models

-   In practice, we maximise the **log-likelihood**
    $$\ell(\mathbf{\beta}) = \log L(\mathbf{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^n y_i \log(p(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\beta})) + (1-y_i) \log(1 - p(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{\beta})).$$

-   The maximiser $\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}$ of $\ell(\mathbf{\beta})$ is called the
    **maximum likelihood estimate** (MLE).

-   There is no closed form solution; it is found via numerical techniques.

-   More on GLMs in 161.327.

---

## Fitting Logistic Regression Models in R

-   Function `glm` used for fitting logistic (and other generalised
    linear) models.

-   Syntax is

        glm(formula, family, data)

-   Here `formula` is the model formula, e.g. `y ~ x1 + x2`.

    -   Make sure `y` is binary 1/0 variable or two-level factor.

-   `family` describes the response distribution.

    -   Specify `family=binomial` for logistic regression.

-   `data` is the data frame to use (optional).

swiss.glm.1 <-
  glm(type ~ margin,
      family=binomial,
      data=swiss.train)
summary(swiss.glm.1)
```

-   `type` is a factor with two levels. `forged` is the first level
    so represents $y=0$. `genuine` represents $y=1$.

-   Coefficient of `margin` is negative, so $\mathsf{P}(\mathsf{genuine} | \mathsf{margin})$
    decreases as `margin` increases.

-   **Deviance** is logistic regression analogue of sum of squares in
    linear regression.

---

## Selection of Predictor Variables

-   If we have $p$ predictors available, we do not necessarily want to
    use all of them.

-   We may get a much better bias-variance trade off by only using some.

-   One option is to compare variety of logistic regressions on
    validation data.

-   Computationally cheap alternative is to do backwards variable
    selection based on AIC.

-   Ideas mirror those you met in linear regression for prediction.

                   data=swiss.train)
step(swiss.glm.2)
```

-   `swiss.glm.2` is logistic regression based on $p=2$ predictor
    variables: `margin` and `diagonal`.

-   Would model be better just using one of those variables?

-   According to AIC criterion, model with both variables has lowest AIC
    (13.260).

-   Dropping either `margin` or `diagonal` makes the model worse.

# Classification with Logistic Regression

---

## Logistic Regression for Classification

-   Logistic regression provides a means of estimating the probability
    of a 1 outcome in a binary response based on predictor variables.

-   Can hence be used for two group classification.

-   Let $\mathbf{x}_0 = (x_{01}, \ldots, x_{0p})^\mathsf{T}$ be feature vector for test
    case.

-   Logistic regression provides estimate of
    $p(\mathbf{x}_0) = \mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}_0)$.

-   Suppose (as usual) that we assign test case to class with highest
    posterior probability.

-   Then assign to class indicated by $y=1$ if and only if
    $\mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}_0) \ge \tfrac12$.

---

## Logistic Regression and Classification Rules

-   Recall that $$p(\mathbf{x}_0) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta(\mathbf{x}_0)}}$$ where
    $\theta(\mathbf{x}_0) = \mathsf{logit}(p(\mathbf{x}_0)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{01} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{0p}$.

-   Classification to class $y=1$ occurs if and only if
    $$\begin{aligned}\mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}_0) \ge \tfrac12 &\Leftrightarrow& \tfrac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta(\mathbf{x}_0)}} \ge \tfrac12 \\ &\Leftrightarrow& e^{-\theta(\mathbf{x}_0)} \le 1 \\ &\Leftrightarrow& \theta(\mathbf{x}_0) \ge 0 \\ &\Leftrightarrow& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{01} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{0p} \ge 0 \end{aligned}$$

-   In practice parameters $\beta_0, \ldots, \beta_p$ replaced by
    maximum likelihood estimates thereof.

---

.left-code[
## Another Look at the Swiss Banknotes

```{r swiss1summary, eval=FALSE}
summary(swiss.glm.1)
```

-   For this model, linear predictor is
    $\theta(\mathsf{margin}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathsf{margin}$.

-   MLEs are $\hat \beta_0 = `r beta0`$ and $\hat \beta_1 = `r beta1`$.

-   Hence fitted model has linear predictor
    $`r beta0` `r beta1` \times \mathsf{margin}$

```{r, ref.label='swiss1summary', echo=FALSE}

.left-code-wide[
## Another Look at the Swiss Banknotes

-   Classify to class coded by $y=1$ (genuine notes) if and only if
    $$\begin{aligned}`r beta0` `r beta1` \times \mathsf{margin} \ge 0 &\Leftrightarrow \mathsf{margin} \le \frac{`r beta0`}{`r -beta1`} \\ &\Leftrightarrow \mathsf{margin} \le `r round(-beta0/beta1,3)`.\end{aligned}$$

-   This is a pretty sensible place to split the training data.

## Classifying by Logistic Regression in R

-   Assume we classify to class coded by $y=1$ if and only if
    $\mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}_0) \ge \tfrac12$.

-   Recall that this is equivalent to
    $\theta(\mathbf{x}_0) = \mathsf{logit}(p(\mathbf{x}_0)) \ge 0$.

-   Can use `predict()` or `broom::augment()` to get estimated posterior probabilities.

-   But beware, prediction for logistic regression can be on one of
    two scales.

    -   Predictions on **response scale** are estimated probabilities.

    -   Predictions on scale of linear predictor -- i.e. logit.

-   Default in R is prediction on logit scale.

-   Can specify predictions on response scale through `type` argument to
    `predict()`, or `type.predict` to `augment()`:

-   E.g. `augment(my.glm, newdata=test.data, type.predict="response")`.

---

swiss.glm.2 |>
  augment(newdata = swiss.test,
          type.predict = 'response') |>
  slice_head(n=3)
```

-   For test case 1, $\hat \theta(\mathbf{x}_0) = -18.77$.

-   Hence
    $\mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}_0) = 1/(1+e^{-\hat \theta(\mathbf{x}_0)}) = 1/(1+e^{18.77}) \approx 0$.

  )
swiss.glm.pred

to classify by creating a factor from
whether it's greater than zero or not.

## Symptoms of COVID-19 cases in New Zealand

We have data on both confirmed cases and those tested but confirmed negative,
along with a wide variety of symptoms, age and sex.

These data were analysed in this paper:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8556148/

where they used decision trees and random forests, among other things, to identify symptoms
that are more likely in confirmed cases than those not a case.

We read the data into R and process it a little using:

```{r, message=FALSE}
covid_all <- read_csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~jcmarsha/data/covid19/symptoms.csv") |>
  mutate(across(everything(), as.factor), Status = fct_relevel(Status, "Not_a_case"))
```

---

## Symptoms of COVID-19 cases in New Zealand

We'll split the data into training and testing sets

```{r}
library(rsample)
set.seed(3)
split <- initial_split(covid_all, prop=3/4)

covid.train <- training(split)
covid.test  <- testing(split)
```

Our goal will be to predict the `Status` of an individual, given their symptoms.

We're getting "Not a case" correct, but are doing very badly at predicting cases!

This may be in part due to the data being **imbalanced**: There are far more 'Not a case' than cases.

While the overall performance is good, if we put this into practice we would be telling over half
of the cases that they're all good. **This is bad in a pandemic!**

---

## The classification threshold

- By default, the logistic regression classifier (and most classifiers) classify a case as being in the second class if $\mathsf{P}(y=1 | \mathbf{x}) > 0.5$.

- By using 0.5 as the threshold, we're assuming that each class is equally important.

- In a pandemic, it is much more important to tell a case of COVID-19 that they are a case than it is to tell someone that doesn't have COVID-19 that they don't have it.

- We don't really mind if we classify people who aren't cases as being cases

    - worst case they isolate unnecessarily.

- We *do* mind if we classify people who are cases as being not cases though

    - the consequence is that they don't isolate and may go on to infect others.

- In that case we'd want to use a lower threshold than 0.5, so that we classify more people as cases than as not cases.

---

## ROC curves

- By moving the threshold we're trading off *sensitivity* and *specificity*.

    - Sensitivity: $\mathsf{P}(\mbox{predicted case} | \mbox{true case})$
    - Specificity: $\mathsf{P}(\mbox{predicted not a case} | \mbox{truly not a case})$

- Lowering the threshold means we predict more cases (more $y=1$), increasing sensitivity,but decreasing specificity.

- Increasing the threshold means we predict more non-cases (more $y=0$), increasing specificity, but decreasing sensitivity.

- The **receiver operating characteristic** (ROC) curve describes how the sensitivity
and specificity change as the threshold changes.

    - Plots sensitivity against 1-specificity.

    - Use `roc_curve()` in `yardstick()`

the sensitivity, but decrease specificity.

## Results with the alternate threshold

```{r, warning=FALSE}
covid.pred2 <- covid.pred |>
  mutate(.pred_class_alt = 
           factor(.pred_Confirmed > 0.185,
                  levels = c(FALSE, TRUE),
                  labels = c("Not_a_case", "Confirmed")))
covid.pred2 |>
  conf_mat(truth=Status, estimate=.pred_class_alt)
```

This gives us much better performance on the confirmed cases, but much worse performance overall.

The misclassification rate is not a fair measure of what is important to us.

## Assigning misclassification costs

We could instead assign costs to the two errors and compute total costs.

 - assign a cost of 1 to getting not a case wrong.
 - assign a cost of 10 to getting a confirmed case wrong.

```{r}
cost_fun <- function(truth, prediction) {
  case_when(truth == "Not_a_case" & prediction == "Confirmed" ~ 1,
            truth == "Confirmed" & prediction == "Not_a_case" ~ 10,
            TRUE ~ 0)
}

covid.pred2 |> mutate(lr = cost_fun(Status, .pred_class),
                       lr_alt = cost_fun(Status, .pred_class_alt)) |>
  summarise(across(starts_with('lr'), sum))
```

By this measure, the alternate threshold is much better.

# More than two classes

## Multinomial Regression

---

## More than Two Classes

-   In logistic regression, probability $\mathsf{P}(y = 1|\mathbf{x})$ related to the
    predictors via the linear predictor,
    $\theta(\mathbf{x}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1} + \cdots + \beta_p x_{p}$.

-   Can extend to $C$ classes by defining $C-1$ linear predictors,
    $\theta_1(\mathbf{x}), \ldots, \theta_{C-1}(\mathbf{x})$.

-   Probability of class $j$, $p_j(\mathbf{x}) = \mathsf{P}(j | \mathbf{x})$, an increasing
    function of $\theta_j(\mathbf{x})$.

-   Probabilities appropriately scaled to ensure that all in interval
    $[0,1]$, and that $\sum_{j=1}^{C-1} p_{j}(\mathbf{x}) \le 1$.

-   Final class probability given by
    $p_C(\mathbf{x}) = 1 - \sum_{j=1}^{C-1} p_j(\mathbf{x})$.

-   Model referred to as a **multinomial** regression because there are
    multiple classes for the response (target variable).

---

## Implementation of Multinomial Model in R

-   Lots of parameters to estimate. There are $C-1$ linear predictors, each with $p+1$ parameters.

-   Multinomial regression is equivalent to a (classification) neural network with no hidden layers, and a
sigmoid transformation on the output.

-   This is what is done by the `multinom` function in the `nnet` package.

-   We'll use the `tidymodels` framework via the `multinom_reg()` specification.

-   As we use `nnet()` under the hood, we need to beware of numerical problems.

    -   Best to scale predictors that are large in magnitude.

## Computerized Wine Tasting

- We consider some data on Italian wines.

- We have 100 records in the training set.

- 78 records in an artificial test set.

- Aim is to classify the wine `Cultivar` based on $p=13$ chemical measurements.

- `Cultivar` has three classes, `A`, `B` and `C`.

## Computerized Wine Tasting

```{r winemn, results='hide'}
wine.mn <- multinom_reg() |>
  fit(Cultivar ~ ., data=wine.train)
wine.mn
wine.mn |>
  augment(new_data=wine.test) |>
  conf_mat(
    truth=Cultivar,
    estimate=.pred_class
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
get_perf <- function(data, true, pred) {
  data |> summarise(wrong = sum({{pred}} != {{true}}), total = n(),
                      perc = round(wrong/total*100,1))
}
perf.mn <- wine.mn |>
  augment(new_data=wine.test) |>
  get_perf(Cultivar, .pred_class)
```

Coefficients are shown only for cultivars `B` and `C`,
as the `A` cultivar is determined as probabilities must
sum to 1.

The misclassification rate is $`r perf.mn$wrong`/`r perf.mn$total` \approx `r perf.mn$perc`\%$.

## Computerized Wine Tasting

```{r, results='hide'}
library(nnet)
wine.mn2 <- multinom(Cultivar ~ .,
                     data=wine.train)
wine.mn2.step <- step(wine.mn2)
wine.mn2.step
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
wine.mn2.step
```

Can perform step-wise regression, but not
within the `tidymodels` framework, so need
to do this directly with `multinom`.

---

## Computerized Wine Tasting

Once we know which variables to use from the step wise procedure, we can re-fit using `tidymodels`.

```{r winerefit}
wine.mn2.refit <- multinom_reg() |>
  fit(Cultivar ~ Alcohol + Flav + Hue + Proline, data=wine.train)
wine.mn2.pred <- wine.mn2.refit |>
  augment(new_data = wine.test)
wine.mn2.pred |>
  conf_mat(truth=Cultivar, estimate=.pred_class)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
perf.mn2 <- wine.mn2.pred |> get_perf(Cultivar, .pred_class)
```

The misclassification rate of the simpler model is $`r perf.mn2$wrong`/`r perf.mn2$total` \approx `r perf.mn2$perc`\%$.
